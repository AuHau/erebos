title: Individual APIs
---

The [`SwarmClient` class](swarm-client.md) provides the following APIs, but they can also be used individually:

- [Bzz APIs](api-bzz.md) for file storage (includes feeds)
- [Pss APIs](api-pss.md): Postal Services over Swarm (UDP-like messaging)

Additional [data structures](data-structures.md) built on top of these APIs are implemented in other packages.
